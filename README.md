# Brickworks-rs 

Brickworks-rs is a Rust port of the [Brickworks](https://www.orastron.com/algorithms#collections-bundles) audio DSP library, designed for real-time audio processing. The aim of this project is to provide both a pure Rust implementation and an FFI wrapper around the original C library to compare performance and correctness.

## Example of use
